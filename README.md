# Ansible Setup

This is a set up script for my personal linux rig. Currently only tested for Ubuntu / Debian builds. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

## Using

Install git, and ansible

```
sudo apt install git ansible
```

Create and [SSH key for github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

When prompted, enter in __Git Name__, __Git Email__, and __ssh keypath__ from whatever was saved from the previous step
